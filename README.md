# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period.
I solved this problem using Data science and Machine learning technology, developed a web application which predicts the "Concrete compressive strength" based on the quantities of raw material, given as an input. Sounds like this saves a lot of time and effort right !

The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we need for acceptable compressive strength. This is what accomplished by this project. Predict the compressive strength by providing the composition of materials either as a single sample value or as a batch file of many sample input Data

## Approach:

1. Loading the dataset using Pandas and performed basic checks like the data type of each column and having any missing values.
2. Performed Exploratory data analysis:
    
3. Experimenting with various ML algorithms:
    
4. Deployment:
    Deployed the XGBoost regressor model using Flask, which works in the backend part while for the frontend UI Web page, used HTML5.

At each step in both development and deployment parts, logging operation is performed which are stored in the development_logs.log and deployment_logs.log files respectively. 

So, now we can find the Concrete compressive strength quickly by just passing the quantities of the raw materials as an input to the web application ðŸ˜Š.
